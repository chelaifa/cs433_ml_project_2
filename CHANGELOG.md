## [1.0.1] - 2025-12-18

### Added
- Highlight the hosted live demo and add linting badges (ESLint + Ruff) to the README so visitors can see current tooling at a glance.

### Changed
- Refreshed the README hero section with the latest release + CI badges and high-level product overview for submissions.
- Upgraded the ML/AI, web, and infrastructure dependencies across the monorepo (packages, Docker images, GitHub Actions, and frontend lockfiles) to the newest tested versions (#14, #15, #17, #18, #19, #20, #21, #22, #23, #24, #25, #26, #27, #28, #30, #31).

### Fixed
- Removed the unused Claude configuration so the repo reflects the currently supported model providers.
